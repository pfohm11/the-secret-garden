            <h2>Welcome to <wbr>The&nbsp;Secret&nbsp;Garden!</h2>
            <p>At The Secret Garden, our passion for plants has helped us to become the largest garden center in the state! We are a family-owned business, founded in 1967, that has served our friends and neighbors in the Seattle area with pride since opening. As we have grown over the years, weâ€™ve focused on offering healthy, beautiful, and Pacific-Northwest-friendly plants to our friends and neighbors. We grow many of our plants from seed and are always working to ensure that our custom plant varieties are hardy and beautiful. We are open seven days a week at our location at 1234 Main Street in Bellevue. Come visit us today!</p>
